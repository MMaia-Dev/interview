# Neo Playground

This is an area to show your familiarity with node.js and JavaScript frameworks.

The project has been setup to start a server with Fastify to serve a large file of JSON which includes 3 sets of different bank accounts and transaction data.

## Requirements

- node.js v14+
- yarn

## Setup

- Clone the repo
- Make sure you have node.js and yarn installed
- Run `yarn` to install packages
- Run `yarn start` to start the server
- Go to http://localhost:3000/api/transactions to see the data you can work with

## Task

Build a simple one page web app using React to talk to this endpoint and surface the data.

- Show the different accounts and a summary of their status
- Show grouped transactions and total amounts

## Improvise

- Could you add any new libraries?
- Can the data be seperated to reduce bandwidth?
- Could you do more than just show the data?

## Submit

- Fork this repo and work there and submit the public repo URL to your contact at Neo
